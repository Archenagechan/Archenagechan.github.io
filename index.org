* Small introduction !!!!
** Welcome OwO !!!!
Welcome everyone to my personal website UwU, it's pretty simple and minimalist so forgive me pwease if it breaks your eyes.

** Who the fuck am I ?
My name is Crystal , I'm 16 years old ( my bday is in the 9th of december :D ) and i'm from Algeria, I speak 4 languages (French English Arabic and Tamazight) . Semi-closeted trans girl and linux and foss enthusiast , one of my dreams is living abroad and joining the FSFondation and work in IT !!!
*** Games i mostly play
I play mostly Portal , Half life, platypus (damn i love this game) , just shapes and beats, minecraft , and i love trying new ones (preferably indi ones , EA can go eat my fluffy bankrupt butt)
** Ok but what is this website ?
Good question , this website made entirely in org mode (doom emacs gang) and my simple css config file  is mainly a rant website , a personal diary, some blog posts about things i discover , and my opinions and projects i work in . So expect to not fully agree with my POV ,and it's fine, cuz we love you because of our differences !! :3

** Great how can i contact you though ?
If you wanna drive by and say hello, feel free to DM me on discord Crystarn#7407 !! Oh also don't forget to check my github profile here : https://github.com/Archenagechan
* Today I learned the sysrq key on my keyboard did a thing!!
I was really surprised when i found out that using ==ALT+SYSRQ(the print key)+ r k== , will kill all programs EXCEPT the init on the current console.
Or ==ALT+SYSRQ+r e i s u o(or b for reboot)== to shutdown your pc, really cool
