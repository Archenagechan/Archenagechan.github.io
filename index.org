* Small introduction !!!!
** Welcome OwO !!!!
Welcome everyone to my personal website UwU, it's pretty simple and minimalist so forgive me pwease if it breaks your eyes.
** Who the fuck am I ?
My name is Crystal , I'm 16 years old ( my bday is in the 9th of december :D ) and i'm from Algeria, I speak 4 languages (French English Arabic and Tamazight) . Semi-closeted trans girl and linux and foss enthusiast , one of my dreams is living abroad and joining the FSFondation and work in IT !!!
** Ok but what is this website ?
Good question , this website made entirely in org mode (doom emacs gang) and my simple css config file  is mainly a rant website , a personal diary, some blog posts about things i discover , and my opinions and projects i work in . So expect to not fully agree with my POV ,and it's fine, cuz we love you because of our differences !! :3 Also this website is under the MIT license

* Quick Patch Note /18/02/2022/
It appeared that the website fonts didn't load for people without JetBrains Mono font installed and so the website looked broken-ish ! Thank you Marie for letting me know <3 , Now everything should be fixed...i hope , otherwise just install that font ,pretty cool one i might add :D !
* HP , the keyboard, and what the fuck happened /17/02/2022/
I fucking hate this , my keyboard randomly stopped reading input from some keys , which are : aqwedcrfvtgb1345 . Well guess i will have to buy a new keyboard for my HP ELITEBOOK 840 G2 (yeah pretty old laptop) , it might not be that bad, since i lost the trackpoint ,and it will be a great opportunity to replace it.
* Today I learned the sysrq key on my keyboard did a thing!! /16|02|2022/
I was really surprised when i found out that using *ALT+SYSRQ(the print key)+ r k* , will kill all programs EXCEPT the init on the current console.
Or *ALT+SYSRQ+r e i s u o(or b for reboot)* to shutdown your pc, really cool
